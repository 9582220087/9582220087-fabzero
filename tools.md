## Digital Fabrication Tools:

# 3D Printers:

3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM) technologies create parts by successively adding material layer by layer until a physical part is created.

# Stereolithography (SLA):

Stereolithography (SLA) uses a laser to cure liquid resin into hardened plastic in a process called photopolymerization. SLA parts are highly accurate, have fine details, smooth surface finish, and isotropic material properties. SLA 3D printing is ideal for complex designs, functional prototypes, manufacturing tooling, and casting patterns. Starting around $3,500, desktop SLA printers are highly versatile tools that are easy to use and accessible to professional users.

# Vinyl Cutter:

A vinyl cutter is a machine controlled by the computer. It is look like a just desktop computer. The movement of the sharp blade over the surface of the material is control by the computer.
