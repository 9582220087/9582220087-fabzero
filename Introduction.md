# Introduction about fabrication lab:

Society faces enormous challenges in constructing a high-quality, future-oriented built environment. Current research on digital fabrication in architecture indicates that the development and integration of innovative digital technologies within architectural and construction processes could transform the building industry - on the verge of a building industry 4.0. Digital technologies in architecture and construction could increase productivity and create new jobs.

A digital fabrication lab is just like a workshop for personal digital fabrication and the aim of digital fabrication lab is to make "almost anything". A digital fab lab have potential to empower individuals to create smart device for themselves and it is limited to mass production.

The fab lab movement is closely aligned with the DIY (do it yourself) movement, open-source hardware, maker culture, and the free and open-source movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.

Digital fabrication is a design and manufacturing workflow where digital data directly drives manufacturing equipment to form various part geometries. This data most often comes from CAD (computer-aided design), which is then transferred to CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) software. The output of CAM software is data that directs a specific machine, like a 3D printer or CNC milling machine.

A wide variety of digital fabrication tools exist, from hobbyist-level machines to large-scale, specialized industrial equipment used in manufacturing. This guide focuses on the most common tools suitable for professional workspaces, machine shops, and workshops

Accessible digital fabrication tools bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. As barriers to professional-level tech lowers, itâ€™s easier for anyone with the skills to design a product to also fabricate it, empowering engineers, product designers, and businesses of all sizes to produce anything from prototypes to final products.
