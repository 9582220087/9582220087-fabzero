# Society faces enormous challenges in constructing a high-quality, future-oriented built environment. Construction sites today, still look much like building sites at the beginning of the 20th century. Current research on digital fabrication in architecture indicates that the development and integration of innovative digital technologies within architectural and construction processes could transform the building industry - on the verge of a building industry 4.0. Digital technologies in architecture and construction could increase productivity and create new jobs.
