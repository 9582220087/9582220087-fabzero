## How to Design and Fabrication of a programmable electronic circuit: 

First of all we start with designing the electronic circuit and 
developing its PCB diagram by using Kicad software and then send it for milling. Then, component soldering and programming followed by testing.

# Draw a schematic diagram:
Design a schematic diagram using Kicad software. Steps are as followed

- STEP 1 
 -- Open KiCAd software  --> open new project --> save with meaningful name in proper location -->
