# How Does Digital Fabrication Work?

## 1. Design:

The first step is to create a virtual model of a design using CAD software. To serve as input for the
fabrication tool, the 3D model is exported as a triangulated mesh, which uniformly describes the geometry
in terms of points on the surface or vertices, the faces between those vertices, the edges of those faces,
and in some cases, the normal vectors and color information pertaining to the faces.

## 2. Prepare:
